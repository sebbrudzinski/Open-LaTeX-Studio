We are currently looking for:

  * Either experienced programmers or people taking their first steps in Java
  * Your task will be to add new features to the editor or fix bugs
  * We have issues of various difficulty levels
  * Your code will be validated by experienced programmer, so you can get actual feedback about your solution
