  \section{Welcome}
  Thanks for trying out the Open \LaTeX{} Studio - an Open Source \LaTeX{} editor. Please note, that the
  application is in constant development. You might encounter some bugs or inconveniences. If that happens, 
  we would be extremely thankful, for letting us know about encountered problems. Any ideas or new feature
  requests are welcome as well! Please see the project page at 
  https://github.com/sebbrudzinski/Open-LaTeX-Studio
  or contact us via mailing list: open-latex-studio@googlegroups.com

  \section{Features}
  New features and fixes are added to the project on a regular basis. Currently, the application provides
  a nifty code editor, with syntax highlight, basic code completion and live preview. You can also save your tex 
  documents or generate PDF documents from your \LaTeX{} code. For the 
  application to work, it is necessary to have the path to the pdflatex set in an 
  environment variable. If you cannot see anything in the preview window, it most likely means that
  the path is not set. The application also providies integration with Dropbox.
